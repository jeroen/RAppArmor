Description: Bindings to kernel methods for enforcing security restrictions. 
    AppArmor can apply mandatory access control (MAC) policies on a given task 
    (process) via security profiles with detailed ACL definitions. In addition
    this package implements bindings for setting process resource limits (rlimit),
    uid, gid, affinity and priority. The high level R function 'eval.secure' 
    builds on these methods to perform dynamic sandboxing: it evaluates a single
    R expression within a temporary fork which acts as a sandbox by enforcing 
    fine grained restrictions without affecting the main R process. A portable 
    version of this function is now available in the 'unix' package.
