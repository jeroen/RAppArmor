3.2.4
 - Fix a printf warning for CRAN

3.2.3
 - Fix strict-prototypes warnings
 
3.2.2
 - Make eval.secure an alias of unix::eval_safe (it was a wrapper before)
 - Manual makes it even more clear that eval.secure is now unix::eval_safe
 
3.2.1
 - Fix for CRAN: do not use CPP in configure

3.2
 - Move unix from Imports to Depends because many old examples from the paper
   assume that the rlimit_ functions are attached when using RAppArmor.

3.1
 - Build (mostly dummy) on MacOS so that other packages can depend on RAppArmor 
   and use it on supported systems. Neither apparmor nor affinity works on MacOS
   but rlimit and priority does work.
 
3.0
 - The non-apparmor functions have been split out into a separate 'unix' package
 - Replace 'parallel' with the new 'sys::eval_fork()' for eval.secure
 
2.0.2
 - Advertise that package can be installed on non-apparmor systems
 - Improve onAttach message on non-apparmor systems
 
2.0.1
 - Configure script automatically sets NO_APPARMOR if kernel was built without AppArmor
 - Disable unit tests for CMD check due to CRAN issues
 
2.0.0
 - Complete rewrite using .Call instead of .C interface
 - Use configure-vars='NO_APPARMOR=1' to build on Fedora / CentOS 7
 - Workaround for race condition in parallel::mccollect()

1.0.2
 - Add timer to eval.secure for better error messages
 - Add 0.01s of pause in eval.secure
 - Fix some unit tests
 - Change closeAllConnections default to FALSE

1.0.1
 - changed method to find libapparmor.so in configure file to work on recent distributions.
 - adding closeAllConnections argument to eval.secure

1.0.0
